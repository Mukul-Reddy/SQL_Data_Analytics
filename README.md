# SQL_Data_Analytics
A comprehensive data analytics project using SQL

For this project, I used the data from a fictional company.  

## Project 1 : EDA

Explored the data using the following:
- Basic SQL queries (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY)  

Got an overview of the customers, products and sales data.

## Project 2 : Data Analytics

Analysed the data using:
- CTE
- Subqueries
- Window Functions

### Customer Report:  
- Customer Segmentation: Classified customers based on their age and purchasing behavior.
- Sales Metrics: Calculated total sales, total orders, and average order value for each customer.
- Customer Recency: Determined how recent a customer's last order is.
- Lifespan Calculation: Calculated the customer's lifespan based on the time between their first and last order.

### Product Report:
- Product Aggregation: Aggregated sales data at the product level, summarizing total sales, total orders, total customers, and other key metrics.
- Product Performance Segmentation: Categorized products into performance segments (High-Performer, Mid-Range, Low-Performer) based on total sales.
- Sales Metrics: Calculated the total number of orders, total sales, total quantity, and average selling price for each product.
- Lifespan Calculation: Determined the lifespan of a product based on the time between its first and most recent sale.
- Recency Calculation: Computed how recently a product was sold, measured in months from the last sale.
- Revenue Metrics: Calculated average order revenue (AOR) and average monthly revenue.
